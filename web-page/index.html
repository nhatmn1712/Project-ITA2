                <h2>Our Project Idea</h2>
                <h3>After studying, researching, and evaluating the TopDev study of Vietnam's information technology sector, I concluded that the nation remains a viable market for new start-ups, particularly in the fields of information technology and artificial intelligence. Therefore, my short-term goal will be to understand the fundamentals of artificial intelligence programming in order to build the framework for my long-term goal of constructing an artificial intelligence capable of recognizing and guessing objects in the real world. It is anticipated that the implementation of a smart surveillance camera system that automatically detects traffic violations, a predictive warning system for natural disasters, and a grading system for cultural behavior will help to address social and environmental concerns while also maintaining national security and order.
When I think about this project, the first thing that comes to me is the desire to alter people's perceptions and behaviors. According to Vietnamnews, over 14,500 accidents occurred in Vietnam in 2020, resulting in over 6,000 deaths and over 10,000 injuries. If artificial intelligence is used in conjunction with surveillance cameras, the frequency of accidents will be significantly reduced, as the artificial intelligence system will serve as the foundation for traffic analysis, categorization, and the legal basis for harshly penalizing those who violate the law. Additionally, by utilizing Big Data with AI evaluation and compilation, weather predictions will deliver relatively precise data, assisting agencies in establishing rapid reaction plans, and providing a foundation for increased dependability for the public. I will describe my project in greater depth in the next paragraph.
Upon implementation, the traffic monitoring system will include smart licence plates, which will allow artificial intelligence features such as easily identifying and fully extracting information about vehicle owners, quickly detecting and reporting daily traffic incidents, and early warning of abnormal traffic behaviour to be optimised. In real-world circumstances, the impacts of artificial intelligence are realised through the deployment of a vast data warehouse that is connected to the healthcare system and that supports staff in retrieving information and making the best decisions possible, among other things. Furthermore, to punish common offences, the AI system will self-identify and make a sanctioning decision based on the applicable legislation; the perpetrator will be fined and provided with photographic and biometric evidence. Additionally, the AI system is integrated with the traffic light system to aid in the reduction of traffic congestion and the rerouting of vehicles during rush hour periods. The use of the aforementioned qualities will result in significant savings in budgetary funds as well as a reduction in the workload of traffic enforcement officers and officers.
Next, the weather forecasting system is also linked to the global positioning satellite system and the world's major astronomical observatories, which is a significant advancement. Because of the continual collection and updating of data presented to the system, AI is able to analyse, calculate, and offer generally accurate results. Activation of the disaster early warning system occurs when abnormal data is detected and analysed by the system. The AI system also actively assists in the prediction of disaster situations that are characterised by complicated and unexpected developments, allowing the government to be more proactive in its reaction to natural disasters. Agriculture can benefit from the capabilities of artificial intelligence systems as well. 
Finally, the system for monitoring cultural behaviour is inextricably linked to the system for monitoring traffic. The system will collect and analyse climatic, weather, and geological data in order to assist farmers in optimising their farming systems and reducing environmental and climate-related damage. Thanks to the CCTV system that will be placed in public areas, it will be able to directly recognise, analyse, judge, and evaluate each individual's behaviour in compliance with the state-issued code of conduct for public places. Identification also assists law enforcement agencies in apprehending criminals. Those who breach the code of conduct will receive a reminder message from the system, and repeat offenders will be recognised by artificial intelligence and forwarded to an authorised person for further action. Additionally, if the AI system detects a situation requiring immediate medical assistance in a public area, it will notify the medical system and the appropriate authorities.
As a result of the long-term nature of my project, issues about programming approaches, hardware, and personnel will grow and improve over time. The project's foundation, however, will be built on Python, a programming language that is well-suited for Machine Learning applications. In this regard, it necessitates a significant amount of human resources in the programming sector, which is why this might be an issue worth considering carefully. According to TopDev's report, the Python platform has a relatively limited number of programmers, which presents an opportunity to both uncover and nurture talent for the purpose of developing and training AI. Additionally, the application of AI to everyday tasks requires significant government assistance, particularly in the form of infrastructure and operation and maintenance costs. 
Following that, below are the talents required to complete this project:
•	Technically proficient in a variety of programming languages
•	Engineering of data
•	Analysis of data
•	Algorithms and Mathematics
•	Adaptability and Rapid Learning
•	Neural Network Architectures 
•	Satellites
For the purpose of determining the viability of the relevant skill sets, software, and hardware, it is important to develop a preliminary project plan. Next, pick or restrict your alternatives based on the criteria you've defined. It's not possible to spend all of your money in phase 1 of a satellite launch since it's a time-consuming and expensive operation that requires meticulous preparation.
If the initiative is successful, it will have a profound effect on society. Daily challenges in society will be reduced greatly, public security and civility will have improved significantly, and people's knowledge, culture, and behavior will have significantly improved. The economy benefits as a consequence. Additionally, the ability to integrate information across departments helps the state apparatus to operate more effectively, closely monitor natural and social oscillations, and react correctly and quickly. Individuals are impacted differently by this development. On the plus side, the system answers a host of unaddressed problems inside society and the political system. Actively contribute to the enhancement of life. However, privacy in public places will be jeopardized since the AI system will continually scan and watch persons, and it will take time for humans to acclimatize to the huge change in public behavior.

            <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
            <p>
                Introduction about Cloud computing:<br>
                Cloud computing is a type of computing that distributes resources fully through the internet based on the needs of the user. If you needed to acquire a web server to establish a website to showcase your items or a hard drive to back up your data in the past, you probably didn't use it to its maximum potential, wasting resources. original. Then, using cloud computing, you'll pay for the services you need and then extra if you wish to broaden your reach. Storage, software, and servers are examples of services. Google Drive is an example of cloud computing; no matter where you are or what device you are using, you will have access to it. You can use the driver to finish your task.<br>
                What can it do right now?<br>
                The purpose of cloud computing is to enable consumers to make use of all these technologies without requiring a detailed understanding or experience in each one. The cloud is designed to reduce expenses and allow customers to focus on their main business rather than being inhibited by IT issues. Users may virtualize any device to manage to do computing operations, making it stand-alone, or can be assigned and utilized more efficiently with the help of the cloud. Virtualization gives you the flexibility you need to speed up IT processes and cut expenses by maximizing infrastructure usage. Automated computing streamlines the process of customers requesting resources on demand. Automation speeds up the process, lowers labor costs, and eliminates the chance of human mistakes by reducing user engagement.
                Providers of cloud computing services provide a variety of service models. The three fundamental categories are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) (SaaS). Data splitting, file storage, and the building of firewalls or local networks are all advantages of these technologies. Customers may also save time by not having to install or manage any hardware or middleware during the creation and implementation of integrations. Furthermore, there are a variety of deployment options to meet the needs of users, such as private cloud, which is a company's infrastructure for providing security and successfully boosting business performance. Public clouds refer to files that are shared via the internet and maybe read by anybody for-profit or nonprofit. Finally, there's a hybrid cloud, which is a combination of public and private clouds. It lets you increase a cloud service's capacity or capabilities by aggregating, integrating, or customizing it with another cloud service.because of the advancement of Bluetooth technology is becoming more readily networked, which contributes to cloud computing's growing interconnection and efficiency. Gadgets that run independently, such as driverless automobiles and home automation devices, will be created in the next years. Because of the epidemic, the zoom software has seen a 160 percent rise in usage by 2020. As a result, cloud technology has grown in popularity, owing to the protection of data as well as the flexibility of working alternatives for all employees, particularly those who work remotely.<br>
                What is the likely impact?<br>
                Cloud computing, it can be claimed, is the advancement of the world; it has been and continues to be enhanced day by day to make our world a better place. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are examples of computer service providers. Companies, people, and enterprises operating on several platforms will be able to employ appropriate and diversified tasks such as data storage and server administration. The capacity to access data from any location and on any device is the most versatile. Many firms, according to Inox Com, have migrated their workloads to the cloud. Cloud computing is used by more than 80% of big organizations. Thus, we can see how crucial cloud computing services are to people's life. The next step is to combine the Internet of Things with cloud computing to make it easier for us to connect with one another using any device and to make us feel like we're part of the network. Finally, as the Online of Things advances, the network's quality will improve, allowing us to download apps and use internet programs more quickly.<br>
                How will this affect you?<br>
                Living in a sophisticated environment where everything is becoming increasingly simple is a blessing for me. My work has been easier and more efficient once I learned about cloud computing. It would be a waste if I had to pay $20 on a 1TB USB stick to store stuff like text and some photos and I couldn't use all of its capacity. I can now keep any file or image on Google Drive without worry of losing it. And, as I previously stated, home automations will make my family more comfortable as it grows. People might instruct my house's artificial intelligence, similar to the Apple series, to switch on the lights or turn on the television. Furthermore, the self-driving automobile system will minimize the frequency of car accidents and make society safer. Everything, however, has two sides. Using assistive devices excessively can cause people to become sluggish and unable to help themselves in some situations, and software-powered devices can occasionally have errors and mishaps. out, maybe the user will be in danger so as far as I can see. Although beneficial, individuals should not overuse it, since social media may lead to people being more disconnected from the real world and disregarding those around them.<br>

            <h1>Cyber Security</h1>
            <p>Introduction<br>
Our technology world is getting more advance every single day, this leads to the data and privacy of the people is getting more important and the threat of hacking getting more difficult to handle. That is why now we have a lot of industries about “cybersecurity” that help solve the problems of protecting data.
What does it do?<br>
What is cybersecurity? Cybersecurity is a process that is designed to protect networks and devices, data from external threats. What is privacy? Privacy means data can only be accessed only by authorized parties. Right now, the main element of cybersecurity is the use of an authentication mechanism, we know this as password, face id, fingerprint, … Why do we need cybersecurity? As today our data is very valuable to us, it impacts our daily life and if our data is leaked or stolen it would be a disaster to our life and bad people can use it to do “bad things” to our life so that cybersecurity industry provided a way to protect our data by cybersecurity professional. They will receive our data and promise with their policy to only help protect our data from “bad people” to help people have more confidence when they access a website without worrying so much about if their data will be stolen or not.  

What is the likely impact?<br>
In everyday life, our data is very important to us that way to enhance people’s confidence in the service and products, customers data a lot of businesses trying to find the best cybersecurity professional to best protect their confidential data. In 2021 reports showed that there were on average 270 attacks per company over the year, a 31% increase over 2020. The third-party risk continues to dominate successful breaches to the organization through the supply chain have increased from 44% to 61%. This shows that the threat of hacking and invade of people’s privacy is getting more dangerous. One of the most important things that a lot of users access or use a service or product that is people usually skip the privacy and policy of data usage of the company or website that provided services, 80% of users do not even bother to read and they just accept whatever is written in the page so that business my sell their data to other third parties and in the way of transferring data to other companies the data may be lost and this causes “hackers” use their data for “bad things”. Secondly every day the way hackers try to steal people’s confidential data is getting more advance as they aim for people who may not know much about using technology and are vulnerable. Some of the ways that hackers use to steal our data are malware, “man in the middle”, phishing, … This has a very negative impact on people living as their data may be stolen and published on social media or be used to blackmail people so that they must pay their money to get the personal data back. One of the worst events that show the dangers of hackers that affect people daily life is called the Wanna Cry Virus happened in 2017 in that time the virus may be created by hackers if this virus invaded the personal computer it asked the user to pay 600 USD in bitcoin to decrypt their virus or their data will be lost forever. Even when users pay 600 USD their data still be invaded by the virus. This is why it is very important that users protect their data safe and do not access or allow the suspicious website to use their data
How will this affect you<br>
As I am living in a technology world my information will be one of the most things that have a heavy impact on my daily life. For example with my social media accounts if my Facebook gets hacked it can be used by hackers to spread “bad news” and the person who will be affected is me because I’m the user of that account. So that I will need to be careful about should I provide my data to a website and is that website is trusted or not. In another scenario, if I go to a place to study English or anything else the policy of using my data is very important as if I do not read the policy carefully they may sell my data to other companies to advertise their products or get my phone number and call me to advertise their products or service. On the other hand, I can provide my data to a trusted company or trusted websites so they can use that data to provide me with the best-fit service or products that the company or website produces, an example would be keyboard if I am using the keyboard for typing or for playing games or for anything else provide that data would be helpful for the shop to know what exactly product that I am looking for so that they can provide the best suitable product. As I’m a student I provided my data to the school so that the school will know about my interest and provide me information about the course and help guide me to study which course is suitable for my future career, and school will have a policy about using my data and my responsibility is to read school policy carefully to know about how the school is going to use data provided by me.

            <h1>Robots</h1>
            <p>What does it do?<br>
                There have been robot concepts and ideas floating around for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Nowadays, robots and automation have progressed to the point that people are no longer just acquainted with them via popular culture and science fiction, but also through the real-life industry. Formerly, the introduction of robots was generally limited to certain industries or experimental services. This is changing. Nonetheless, humans are already reaping the benefits of robots' widespread use in the manufacturing and service industries. To have a better understanding of this problem, let's first describe what it is, what it is capable of, and how it impacts the rest of the universe. Although the notion of a robot has been around for a long time, it was not until the nineteenth century that the term "robot" was first used to describe one. It is derived from a Slavic root term with occupational significance. Robots that have been created and constructed by humans are often fashioned like people and animals, and they are capable of executing a wide variety of complicated actions on their own without the assistance of a person. When it comes to certain vocations, programming's ultimate goal is to fully eliminate the need for human labor. While we often come across robots that are made to seem and behave like people, robots are really built for a certain purpose and with a specific level of responsibility. While people may instruct robots, they are also capable of acting autonomously when under the guidance of a computer. A robot is a machine that can sense its surroundings, do computations, and make practical judgments in the real world. Among the many characteristics of robots are the following: It is possible that there will be significant disparities in the appearance or capabilities of robots. They might be as small as a fingernail or as large as a four-door automobile. It is thus difficult to define and characterize them as a result of this. Three key traits, however, are often shared by them: the capacity to sense their own pulse, to calculate autonomously, and to work in real time. Many of the most lasting traits of contemporary robots may be seen from this vantage point, including the following: The mechanical properties of each of them allow them to function properly in the environment for which they were created. Electrification as a form of propulsion is discussed here. Without this code, they are nothing more than pieces of equipment. Computer chapters have been assigned to them. Throughout the globe, the COVID-19 epidemic exposed the susceptibility and danger of supply chain interruptions. As a result, there is the possibility of a worldwide economic collapse. Several nations have challenged multinational firms to create and reorganize supply networks in order to better reflect current conditions. Almost without a doubt, the area of robotics will see a significant increase in activity in the near future. They have established themselves as prominent and competent in a wide variety of businesses, including manufacturing and services, as well as other sectors. There are several benefits to using them, including automation, long-term durability, and a low likelihood of human mistakes throughout the manufacturing process. Also necessary for global economic success is a huge pool of highly trained human capital. Additionally, robots may be made to look like people and can be used to do a variety of tough and risky tasks in place of humans in a variety of situations (boom removal, aerospace). Artificial intelligence and machine learning are two technologies that have the potential to provide robot help. According to experts, AI and machine learning are also considered crucial future technologies. Because of the advancement of this technology, it has had a large beneficial influence on the area of robotics. AI and machine learning allow robots to improve their quality, grow smarter, and do more complex activities or professions that require them to cope with unforeseen events and communicate with people, as well as to improve their quality and become smarter.
What is the likely impact?<br>
Introduction and positive impacts<br>
Nowadays the robotics industry is starting to grow faster and faster, the impacts of robots on our life are becoming bigger and stronger as there are two sides of a coin, it brings both positive impacts and negative impacts to human life. For instance, we create robots so that they can help human beings avoid dangerous jobs or work in a hazardous environment they can handle lifting heavy loads, toxic substances, and repetitive tasks. This has helped companies to prevent many accidents, also saving time and money. So that means now people do not need to do the hard work like cleaning trash and doing that cause negative impacts to our health and we can just lay down and do the fun work that we love. We can imagine a life in the future where robots are taxi drives, cleaners,… and humans can be artis, coders, musicians. and maybe we can replace our body parts with robots parts. 
Negative impacts<br>
But on the other hand, as the robots are getting more and more advance so that they can replace humans the dangerous jobs but let think about drivers or deliver they use their car or motorbike to provide services to other people and now the robots started to do the job better than real human taxi drivers and deliver may lose their jobs and can not find others ways to make money and so that they may have negative impacts to the society and maybe they will become criminals and try to destroy robots which may cause in destroying other people stuff. 
Should robots be created?
If we look at the good side we can see that with people who do not have problems with their income they will find that the robots help change their life in a better way but with people who have low income and must do the hard work that the robots may replace them in future is really hard to accept that fact so that will be an argument between people causing more problems so that should robots ever be created if it may cause new problems that the world may need to “fix”?
How does it impact you?<br>
Right now in my life, I do not have any robots that help improve my life or make things easier except some toy robots I had when I was a small child. But in my point of view if I have a robot that can help clean the house that definitely helps to make my life easier a lot because I am the person who do all the chores in my house so that is why having a robot which can help me a hand will be more useful so that I may spend that time having a good sleep or use that time to study. But if the robots started to replace humans some of my relatives will be having a hard time in their life as they are drivers or workers who work at construction the robots may replace them and they may lose their job and I will feel bad for them. If maybe the robots are so advanced in future and they have so much data and they can code better than me or do something that involves my future job and I may get replaced by a robot definitely I will feed very sad and may become a person who can not find a job (bum). As I am studying at RMIT university at some point in my studying journey I will have to study a little bit about robots so that robots will help me understand how the machine works better and help me have better knowledge. This is all future thoughts as right now the robots are not advanced enough to completely replace humans so that is why now robots are not having any impacts on my life except if my parents accept me buying a cleaning robot that will be a lot easier for me

The first section we shall discuss is Machine Learning.<br>
 Definition: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) technology that enables a system to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is concerned with the development of computer programs capable of independently accessing data and using it for self-learning. The learning process starts with viewing data, such as direct experience, instruction, or examples, in order to identify patterns in the data and make more informed future judgments based on the instances. The primary goal is to enable computers to learn autonomously and alter their behavior appropriately without human assistance or intervention.
 Special Features:<br>
 ● Data visualization: Every day, a massive quantity of data is generated and saved from regular customers. Machine learning provides a variety of technologies that generate large amounts of data that can be used for both unstructured and structured data. Businesses may use machine learning and data visualization tools to solve current issues or enhance their operations. <br>
● Automation: One of the most distinguishing features of machine learning is its capacity to automate repetitive processes, hence enhancing job efficiency. Numerous businesses and organizations have applied for paperwork that is automated using machine learning and email. For example, in the banking industry, a high volume of repetitive, predictable jobs must be completed. As a result, several machine learning models may be deployed and have a significant impact in this field. This speeds up and improves the accuracy of accounting procedures. Additionally, machine learning has been used to solve financial inquiry issues through chatbots, make forecasts, manage to spend, streamline invoicing, and automate banking modifications. 
● Data analysis: Typically, data analysis involves two methods: trial and error, which is impractical when dealing with large and heterogeneous data sets. Machine learning is the optimal answer to the aforementioned issues since it enables efficient data analysis. By creating quick and efficient algorithms and data-driven models for real-time data processing. Machine learning is capable of producing precise analytics and outcomes.
 ● IoT: Machine learning is gaining popularity as a result of the excitement around IoT. Numerous businesses see the IoT as a critical sector. Numerous pilot projects have been conducted to assess the IoT's potential in a corporate environment. However, gaining advantages from the IoT is not straightforward. In this scenario, machine learning is arguably the most effective technique for increasing efficiency. By combining machine learning and the IoT, businesses can optimize their entire process.<br> 
Practical features: 
● Medical evaluation: Machine learning may be utilized to develop diagnostic approaches and tools. It is used to assess clinical factors and their combinations in order to forecast prognostic instances of illness development and to amass medical information for the purpose of determining the result of research. Machine learning may therefore be used to assist in the integration of computer-based systems in the healthcare industry.<br> 
● Prediction systems: Consider loan drills; in order to determine the mistake probability, the system must first categorize the data into groups. It is decided using analysts' recommended algorithms. After we have completed the specification, we may compute the likelihood of a mistake. These estimates are applicable to all industries and for a variety of applications. 
● Finance industries: It is the driving factor behind the financial services industry's appeal. Banks and financial organizations may benefit from machine learning by making more informed judgments. Additionally, machine learning has a plethora of other skills, like market analysis, monitoring client spending habits, recognizing consumption trends, and responding in real-time. 
Future features: 
● Transportation: In several cities in the United States, self-driving passenger automobiles are now accessible. Autonomous cars may be spotted on the road in cities ranging from San Francisco to Las Vegas to Miami. However, machine learning and artificial intelligence are capable of much more, which is an application for self-driving emergency ambulances. 
The next section will address AI:
 Definition: Artificial intelligence, abbreviated as AI, is a subfield of computer science. Human-created intelligence with the purpose of assisting computers in automating intelligent actions similar to those of humans. It differs from logic programming in programming languages by the use of machine learning systems to simulate human intelligence in processes that humans perform better than computers, such as problem-solving through thought and reasoning, communication through language and speech, and learning and self-adaptation. 
Features: 
● Traffic: If this is done, AI features such as information about car owners can be quickly and easily found through license plates, as can daily traffic events be alerted and promptly report violations or incidents. In addition, the AI system is integrated with the traffic signal system to assist in reducing traffic congestion and reallocating traffic during peak hours.
 ● Healthcare: In the real world, AI is synchronized with the huge data store of the health system, helping people find information and make the best decisions. 
● Crime detection and notification: For the vast majority of typical crimes, the AI system will automatically detect and alert the appropriate authorities about crimes in the vicinity. 
● Weather Forecasting: A weather forecasting system that is integrated with an AI to analyze, compute, and provide findings for early warning of catastrophes, enabling the government to be more proactive in reacting to disasters. Simultaneously, the application of AI systems in agriculture may be beneficial. Climate, meteorological, and geological data will be collected and analyzed to assist farmers in optimizing their agricultural operations. 
● Cultural behavior: Through the CCTV system, AI will analyze, assess, and promptly evaluate each person's behavior in public locations in compliance with the state's code of conduct. Simultaneously, it will alert the health system when it observes circumstances requiring emergency medical assistance in a public setting. <br>
The benefits of these technologies, which include machine learning and artificial intelligence, are self-evident. The spread of big data has inaugurated a new era in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Their innovations have benefited humanity in practically every aspect of its existence. The optimization, automation, and, most importantly, learning capabilities of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies are providing considerable assistance in essential areas of the world today, such as transportation, healthcare, and education. Apart from its capabilities, machine learning technology also has the potential to directly replace human vocations while also indirectly increasing the unemployment rate, so worsening social difficulties in the process. Additionally, boosting artificial intelligence and machine learning may have the unintended consequence of increasing people's dependency on them. Individuals who perform duties such as moderators, user help, and workers will be directly influenced by the advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies in the near future. Today, we are continuously exposed to artificial intelligence technologies, and we may be anywhere. Technological advancements in artificial intelligence allow the comforts that are demanded in today's society. I feel that artificial intelligence technology is really important from the standpoint of the typical client. The apparent distinction is intended to aid people in maximizing their time while also lowering their dependency on staff and other external resources

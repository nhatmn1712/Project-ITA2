                        <p>A position that appeal to me is Chief Technical Officer. I think this position is a motivation for me because CTO is an important person in a company that can help with many issues related to technology. Moreover, CTO usually have a high salary so they don’t struggle too much with finance when they spending money.  </p>
                        <p>From my perspective, CTO required a lot of skills, qualifications, and experience because they have to make a decision when a company receive the important project. Moreover, they have to lead a group of employees or their colleagues to the goal or a target of the company. They have a responsibility when the project has an error.</p>
                        <p>I just an amateur and I don’t have any skills yet but I try to learn as much as I can to have more knowledge about the IT world. Moreover, I know how to code some basic things on Python and I will learn more in the future. </p>
                        <p>Firstly, I will obtain skills from lectures at RMIT University because they have more knowledge and experience than me. Secondly, I will ask people who have learned already about IT to understand more what they have learned in the past.  Finally, I think I can research more in the internet or asking my friends if they know about how to obtain the skills, qualifications, and experience.</p>
